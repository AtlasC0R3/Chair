# Chair
A profile picture that I often use online. It's a cat. That looked like a chair at first. Hence the name "Chair".
Now he looks like a fridge. Or a Wiimote. Or an American power outlet.

## 1.0
From January 25th, 2020 at 2:30 PM. Quick little thing made in GIMP with nothing but the Paintbrush tool. 
Note: I once had the GIMP file, but lost it some time ago. Guess it wasn't preserved right...
### pre.png
This isn't *the* original "chair" drawing I attempted to make, but it is a rough recreation of it. I tried making an actual chair, thing you sit on.
You can kinda see it, if you squint. But it really looked more like a cat to me. And it still does.
### original.png
The first image I actually used as a profile picture. It now looked like a cat! I named it "Chair". 
Fun fact: the original file name for this was "accidentally good cat drawing.png".
### inverted square 500px.png
Weird file name. It's literally just with a black background and cropped to be 500px. I made this revision in February 2020.

## 2.0
I once wanted to remake Chair, but in a way that didn't make it look like a toddler's drawing.
So, back in GIMP, I remade it, but with the curvy path thingy. And, might I add, it looks pretty good.
In fact, I made this on **June 4, 2020, 9 PM (in my timezone)** and **it still lives on to this day (2022!)**. Sort of.
### cat 2.0.png
The original one. I unfortunately don't think I saved it as a GIMP file, but it doesn't really matter much since I thankfully saved it as a 2000px PNG.
### cat 2.0, body.png
A few days later, I edited (I think the PNG file) to remove facial expressions, ears and arms. Leaving only the neck. *Yes, that's a neck, not a mouth. It never had a mouth.*
### cat 2.1.png (lost)
This was a variation of *cat 2.0.png*, but with a background gradient that was honestly too bright.
### cat 2.2.png (lost)
Same thing, with a gradient that was honestly too dark.
### cat 2.3.png
The original, but with a gradient background that I think struck a great balance of light and dark.
I made this on *February 11, 2021, 10:10 PM (in my timezone)*, and that's what I used pretty much until October 2022 as a profile picture.
#### cat 2.3-min.png
Compressed version that I also often used.

### animated/
These were made on *February 13, 2021, 2:38 PM*.
I believe I just adapted *cat 2.3.png*, put it in [Wick Editor](https://www.wickeditor.com/) and made it blink.
#### animated/animated cat optimized.gif
Optimized GIF. This time, it's under 20 damn megabytes!
#### animated/animated cat really compressed.gif
Same thing. But under 512 KB. Too compressed.
#### discord animated.gif
I probably just used the really compressed one, and added a delay at the final frame so that Chair isn't constantly blinking all the time.

## 3.0
October 15th, 2022, at around 8 AM. I just finished remaking and exporting yet another remake of Chair.
There isn't much difference between 3.0 and 2.0, visually. It's the same type of thing, with a slightly different silhouette, maybe different position of the eyes, and skewed ears. 
The technical difference is pretty major, however. **This is now a vector image**. So basically, 2.0, but vector. 
I made this in Adobe Illustrator (obligatory boo for using proprietary software).
Hopefully the file names are descriptive enough.

**NOTE: `exports/` may not be up-to-date with the original `Chair.ai` file!** I'd advise using the SVG or PNG files if you'd like to stay up-to-date.

## 3D/
Because for some reason I tried making Chair in 3D. 
### blocky/
It's dumb.
### blender/
It's less dumb. 
(I actually used this one as my banner on [my old Mastodon account](https://mastodon.online/@atlas_core))
